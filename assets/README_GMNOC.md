This directory contains our improvement of the original GMN on molecular dynamics data---The Open Catalyst Challenge. We add multi-head mechanism and a global representation module to enhance the performance of the model.

Please refer to the following files for GMN-OC model: `gmnoc.py`, `layer.py`, `gmn_temp.py`, `smearing.py`, and the config file `config_gmnoc.yml`.

We achieved the first place in Open Catalyst Challenge 2022. See the annoucement on [the official website](https://opencatalystproject.org/challenge.html) and our [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFRlpw51Okk).
